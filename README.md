WiFi Microscope Viewer
======================

This is a simple viewer for cheap WiFi microscope cameras. This only supports 1280x720
resolution and does nothing more than display the stream.

Tested with the [Dodocool Microscope](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Microscope-Wireless-Magnifying-Endoscope-Inspection/dp/B08NP37B7X)

It requires SDL2 and SDL2_image to operate:

```bash
$ sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev
```

To compile just type `make`
